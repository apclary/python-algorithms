## Python Algorithms

This is intended to be a collection of Python implementations of various CLRS algorithms, just for fun and practice. It's been awhile since I've taken CS classes so I want to refresh my memory. I also wanted to gain some experience with Python testing and Travis CI.

Run tests with `python -m unittest discover` from the `python-algorithms` directory.
